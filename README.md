Basic banking system which keeps the track of the transactions done by its users.

Details: 
Frontend: HTML,CSS,Bootstrap
Backend: Django

Here in this project I had used 2 models :
1. Customer model for keeping the basic details of the customer 
2. Transaction history model to keep track of our transactions

We basically have these pages :
1.Home page 
2.Customer page which has list of all the customers 
3. History page which shows all the transaction histories
4. Profile and transfer money page through which a sender can transfer money to the receiver
